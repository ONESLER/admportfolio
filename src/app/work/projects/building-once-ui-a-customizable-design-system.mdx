**CHALLENGES AND LEARNINGS**

One and most challenging on us as a group was the time of effort of taking up photos around the school, and reviewing them on site if needed to do a re-take of photos. Sometimes a day of taking up photos wasn't enough on us, sometimes there would be a problem like the photos are different and not consistent, in the next photo there would be there in the photo like car which aren't included in the previous photo.

**OUTCOME**

The outcome of this research of us group were outstanding and we manage to defend it flawlessly.
