**Overview**

In this project, as my first job in a company, I try to look on what should I do to contribute in this company. But as few months goes by, my superior Sir Arnold Mirano, told me he was planning to create a task management and as for me as an sofware developer, I assess his idea and decided to do a prototype first and implement some features.

**Key Features**

- **Continuous Sync**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Scalable Design System**: Leveraged a design system that remains the single source of truth for both designers and developers, making it easy to maintain consistency even as the product evolves.

**Technologies Used**

- **Laravel Framework**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

**Challenges and Learnings**

- On the first prototype I create the task management, using with a Visual Basic framework with ease of my knowledge and experience in that structure I finished the project in (1)one and half week developing it. And I showed it to my supior and he liked it, the only problem there and as I also pointed it out, in this software application such as this, if ever will be change for additional features in the future implimenting will be a quite hustle. And I suggest that I will also create a prototype in a web-based. In a website a lot can be implimented with a ease of implimenting of new features and easy to do a maintenance and debug. As am I looking for new framework or code structure other than my usual way of developing a software, I ask for my good friend of what should I try learning for new framework, and he suggest me the Laravel framework.

- As I try reading the documentation for the laravel framework, its not that kind of complexity in understanding but it sure does not easy to understand in a instant. Especially the routes as such, but as I wanted to learn this new framework it gives me a challenge and fun for myself, after stressing too much I finally figure it out how this structure works.

- As I almost finished in developing the task-management website, with all features are already implimented with a working database, the current problem of the project was the output report.

**Outcome**

This project has proven me that continues learning of new will be added value to yourself, the knowledge and understanding of it, all will be yours.
